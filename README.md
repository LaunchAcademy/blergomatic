### Blergomatic

The Blergomatic app is here to help you arrange your favorite articles in an Object Oriented way!

That is...if you are a super cool author. Only authors allowed!

### Running the Program
This is a test driven exercise, and the classes we define are only used by the test. Get all of the tests to pass in order to complete the exercise.

### Goals
- working with data structures and class composition
- debugging with pry - in both in our code & our tests
- interpreting the intent of the test
- a large textual operation
